Some plans/ideas for what to do:

High priority:
    * proof of concept frontend
    * comments, trackbacks
    * tags
    * caching

Low priority:
    * more backends
    * Add more magic (automatic linking for example?) to Renderer::Text
    * JSONFile storage: make the index file plain text, one post per
      line -- should be much faster than JSON (conjectural)
    * make storage backends work under -T, and test it.
    * Markdown renderer
