Some plans/ideas for what to do:

General items on the agenda:
    * caching
    * more backends
    * proof of concept frontend
    * comments, trackbacks
    * API for updating posts
    * tags

JSONFile backend:
    * make the index file plain text, one post per line -- should be much
      faster than JSON
    * updating posts
    * more docs
